# CityClassifier
A City Image Classifier that can be accessed through a simple web app.
I worked on this for the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/index.html) for Lesson 1&2.
Therefore my Notebook is mainly drawn from there.
## How to reproduce
1. To get the City Dataset, have a look at [this notebook](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson2-download.ipynb) and follow sections 'Get a list of URLs' and 'Download images'.
2. Now we can train on the data in the train.ipynb Notebook. The model will be saved in the end as 'export.pkl'.
3. Inference is also done at the end of the train.ipynb Notebook.

## How to use the web app
